Title: Easy Access to Model Information for Various Model Objects
Description: Gain insight into your models! The goal of this package is to 
   provide an easy, intuitive and consistent access to information contained 
   in various R models. Although there are generic functions to get information 
   and data from models, many modelling-functions from different packages do 
   not provide such methods to access these information. The insight package 
   aims at closing this gap by providing functions that work for (almost) 
   any model.
